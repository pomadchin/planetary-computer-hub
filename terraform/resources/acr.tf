# This is some leftover cruft from the common -> staging / prod split.
# We want to re-use the ACR that was originally created under common.
# We'll keep managing the actual ACR with prod, and will attach it
# here (in resources) for staging and prod.

# If deploying for the first time, you might put it in a manual resource
# and just use the ID, like we're doing below, or use a separate
# ACR per environment.
